## Getting Started

To start using Kiwi, please follow the instructions below. 

### Docker

Experiment with Kiwi in a Docker container.

```bash
sudo docker build -t kiwi-lang .
sudo docker run -it -v $(pwd):/workspace kiwi-lang
```

### Linux Builds

To build Kiwi, use your favorite C++ compiler.

This repo uses GCC and Make.

#### Fedora / RHEL

```bash
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install gcc-c++
sudo dnf install make
```

#### Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install make
```

Then build with Make.

```bash
make
```

#### Installing Kiwi on Linux

Download the repository and run `sudo make install` to build Kiwi and run the installation script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fuseraft/kiwi.git
cd kiwi
sudo make install
```

##### To manually install Kiwi after it is built, run:

```bash
./bin/kiwi configure install
```

##### To uninstall Kiwi, run:

```bash
kiwi configure uninstall
```

### Windows (WSL2)

To run Kiwi on Windows, you can use [WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/). This provides a full Linux environment on Windows, allowing you to build and run Kiwi as if on a native Linux system.

#### Setting Up WSL2

1. **Install WSL2**: Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```
   This command installs WSL2 with the default Linux distribution (usually Ubuntu). Restart your computer if prompted.

2. **Install Development Tools**: Open WSL and install the necessary tools:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install g++ make
   ```

3. **Clone and Build Kiwi**: Clone the Kiwi repository and build it using `make`:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fuseraft/kiwi.git
   cd kiwi
   make
   ```

4. **Run Kiwi**: After building, you can run Kiwi directly in WSL:
   ```bash
   ./bin/kiwi
   ```

*Note: WSL2 provides a fully-featured Linux environment, so Kiwi runs natively in this environment without the need for Windows-specific adjustments.*

### Visual Studio Code Extension

You can install the [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fuseraft.kiwi-lang) for syntax-highlighting in VS Code.

Launch VS Code Quick Open (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>), paste the following command, and press enter.
```
ext install fuseraft.kiwi-lang
```

## Documentation

### Kiwi Wiki
