## Getting Started

To start using Kiwi, please follow the instructions below. 

### Docker

Experiment with Kiwi in a Docker container.

```bash
sudo docker build -t kiwi-lang .
sudo docker run -it -v $(pwd):/workspace kiwi-lang
```

### Linux Builds

To build Kiwi, use your favorite C++ compiler.

This repo uses GCC and Make.

#### Fedora / RHEL

```bash
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install gcc-c++
sudo dnf install make
```

#### Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install make
```

Then build with Make.

```bash
make
```

#### Installing Kiwi on Linux

Download the repository and run `sudo make install` to build Kiwi and run the installation script.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fuseraft/kiwi.git
cd kiwi
sudo make install
```

##### To manually install Kiwi after it is built, run:

```bash
./bin/kiwi configure install
```

##### To uninstall Kiwi, run:

```bash
kiwi configure uninstall
```

### Windows Builds

You can find a 64-bit build (named **`kiwi.exe`**) in the latest release.

To build on Windows, you need to open a [64-bit hosted developer command prompt](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/how-to-enable-a-64-bit-visual-cpp-toolset-on-the-command-line?view=msvc-170).

Then navigate to the source code and run [`build.bat`](build.bat).

```cmd
cd path\to\kiwi
build.bat
```

*Note: The Windows build does not support `.ü•ù` files (use the `.kiwi` extension).*

### Visual Studio Code Extension

You can install the [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=fuseraft.kiwi-lang) for syntax-highlighting in VS Code.

Launch VS Code Quick Open (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>), paste the following command, and press enter.
```
ext install fuseraft.kiwi-lang
```
