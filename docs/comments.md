# Comments

## Single line comments

Single line comments begin with a `#`.

```kiwi
# this will print "hello"
println("hello")
```

## Block comments

Block comments begin with `/#` and end with `#/`.

```
/#
Using a double-# will give you a multiline/block comment.

Use this to document more complicated logic.

We all love documentation. :)
