# Contributing to Kiwi

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Kiwi! Let's build something amazing!

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Kiwi. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Kiwi, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Kiwi? You can start by looking through `beginner` and `help wanted` issues:

- **Beginner issues** - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- **Help wanted issues** - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Kiwi's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Kiwi

Here's how to submit a pull request:

1. **Fork** the repo and **create your branch** from `main`.
2. **If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.**
3. **Ensure the test suite passes.**
4. **Make sure your code lints.**
5. **Issue that pull request!**

### Testing Your Changes

Before you submit a pull request, please test your changes.

1. Add your test script to the [test suite](test.ü•ù).
2. Run the test suite through [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/).
    > `valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes ./bin/kiwi test.ü•ù`

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- **Note**: I'm pretty relaxed on this.
- Try to use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Try to use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

- **bug** - Issues that are bugs.
- **enhancement** - Issues that are feature requests.
- **good first issue** - Good for newcomers.
