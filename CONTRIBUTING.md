# Contributing to Kiwi

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Kiwi!

## How Can I Contribute?

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples** to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Kiwi? You can start by looking through `beginner` and `help wanted` issues:

- **Beginner issues** - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
- **Help wanted issues** - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Kiwi's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Kiwi

Here's how to submit a pull request:

1. **Fork** the repo and **create your branch** from `dev`.
2. **If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.**
3. **Ensure the test suite passes.**
4. **Make sure your code lints.**
5. **Issue that pull request!**

### Testing Your Changes

Before you submit a pull request, please test your changes.

1. Add your test script to the [test suite](tests/test.kiwi).
2. Run the test suite through Kiwi.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

- **Note**: I'm pretty relaxed on this.
- Try to use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Try to use the imperative mood ("Move function to..." not "Moves function to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

## Additional Notes
